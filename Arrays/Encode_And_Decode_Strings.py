# Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

# Please implement encode and decode

# Example 1:

# Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]

# Output:["neet","code","love","you"]
# Example 2:

# Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]

# Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]
# Constraints:

# 0 <= strs.length < 100
# 0 <= strs[i].length < 200
# strs[i] contains only UTF-8 characters.


def encode(strs: List[str]) -> str:
    res = ""

        res += str(len(s)) + "#" + s

    while i < len(s):
        j = i
        while s[j] != "#":
            j += 1
        length = int(s[i:j])
        word = s[j+1:j+1+length]
